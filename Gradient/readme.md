# Gradient Fill

In this labwork are asked to write a GUI application again using AWT. This is a fairly easy labwork that is more about getting used to synchronized online learning. You are expected to:

- Draw two rectangles.
- Both of them should be filled using GradientPaint() function of AWT. (Check out its function definition that is listed below.)
- The first gradient should be parallel to the diagonal of the first rectangle. The color gradient should not be repeated (acyclic).
- The second gradient should be horizontal. The color gradient should be repeated for this one (cyclic).
- You are free to choose the colors but other than that your output should be similar to the example screenshot given below.
