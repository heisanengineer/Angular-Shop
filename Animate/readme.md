## Animate

In this labwork are asked to write a GUI application using AWT And Swing. You will animate a shooting star which gets smaller and bigger with time. It is highly advised that you build your work and knowledge upon previous labworks. Also you may want to revisit the labwork about gradient paint so that you can review how to fill a rectangle with gradient. You can watch the small video demo on WebOnline to get a better understanding. You should also use your knowledge that you gained during theoretical lecture. By completing this assignment you will have a cute little animation which you have created with knowledge you have gathered during this semester. You are expected to;

- Have a gradient paint background of your liking. I have used Color.getHSBColor( 0.75f, 0.8f, 0.3f ) and Color.getHSBColor( 0.65f, 0.8f, 0.5f ) .
- A star shape that is filled with a color. (You can use GeneralPath)
- Modify the action listener so that it modifies scale of the star which is either increasing or
decreasing by delta with time.
- Set the title to “Shooting Star”.
- Modify your paint method to draw a star and scale it.
- The main method should create and display an instance of Animate().
- The frame should be set to the size 400 by 400.
- Submit only one file called Animate.java.
