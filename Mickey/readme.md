# Mickey Mouse

In this labwork are asked to write a GUI application using AWT. It is highly advised that you build your work and knowledge upon the last labwork. You can watch the small video demo on WebOnline to get a better understanding. In additional to what we did in Lab3 you are going to;

- Add a control panel.
- Add two buttons to the panel called “Smaller” and “Bigger”.
- Menubar of this program should have an item called “Set Default”which will reset the values of x, y, dx and dy to the values they had initially.
- Modify the action listener according to the buttons and menu item.
- Set the title to “Mickey” in the constructor and add your WindowListener.
- Modify your paint method to draw 3 ovals which makes up Mickey Mouse silhouette.
- Smaller ovals have half the radius of the big oval.
- The center of the circle is determined by the variables x and y, and the radius of circles should be dependent on dx and dy (which are equal since we are using circles).
- Have a mouse listener same as the previous lab.
- The main method should create and display an instance of Mickey().
- The frame should be set to the size 800 by 800.
- Background should be red and your ovals should be filled with black.
- Also set the background of the control panel to black.
- You can use a grid layout which is pretty straightforward.
- Submit only one file called Mickey.java.
