# Transformations

In this labwork are asked to write a GUI application using AWT. It is highly advised that you build your work and knowledge upon labwork 4. You can watch the small video demo on WebOnline to get a better understanding. You should also use your knowledge that you gained during theoretical lectures. You are expected to;

- Have a colored background of your liking. I have used Color.getHSBColor(0.8f, 0.2f, 0.9f).
- Two lines that divide the frame into 4 equal parts, that are x and y axes.
- A triangle that is filled with a color. (You can use fillPolygon() function)
- Add a control panel.
- Add 6 buttons to the panel called “Translate Up”, “Translate Down”,“Translate Right”, “Translate Left”, “Reflect X” and “Reflect Y”.
- Menubar of this program should have an item called “Set Default”which will reset the values of x and y to the values they had initially.
- Modify the action listener according to the buttons and menu item.
- Set the title to “Transformations” in the constructor and add your WindowListener.
- Modify your paint method to draw 1 triangle and 2 lines with different colors.
- The main method should create and display an instance of Transformations().
- The frame should be set to the size 800 by 800.
- You can use a grid layout which is pretty straightforward.
- Submit only one file called Transformations.java.
